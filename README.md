# MIT6.824

This repository is to record my learning process for MIT6.824 course, it is a famous course on distributed systems.

My study starts from today, 17,2,2019. I need to get a good intern job after about 20 days.

The Chinese translation of 6.824's documents is here: https://github.com/feixiao/Distributed-Systems, thanks to the authors.

The original 6.824 documents are here: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html

The git clone code for 6.824 is: git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2018 6.824

//Since the 6.824 documents has already been translated by others, I decide to translate the annotations in the source code.

Remember to add the GO PATH of packages for avoiding faults about the package PATH when using Goland.
